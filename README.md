# AI Product Agent – Python Backend

Welcome to the Python backend for **AI Product Agent**! This service delivers advanced AI-driven analysis and automation for your product management platform, integrating seamlessly as the intelligence layer of your MERN stack application. Which is integrated on the application [product_agent_node](https://github.com/YUGESHKARAN/product_agent_node.git).

---

## 🚀 Overview

This backend is built with **Flask** and leverages state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Llama 3 70B) to provide intelligent analysis and automation capabilities. It exposes RESTful APIs consumed by the main product website, enhancing CRUD workflows with AI-powered insights.

---

## 🔥 Features

- **LLM-Powered Analysis:** Integrates Llama 3 70B or similar models for deep data analysis and smart recommendations.
- **RESTful API:** Clean, documented endpoints for easy integration with Node.js/React frontend and backend.
- **CORS-Enabled:** Out-of-the-box support for cross-origin requests.
- **Secure:** Designed for secure communication within your stack.
- **Configurable Model Path:** Easily switch or update AI models as needed.
- **Flexible Image Generation:**  
  - **SerpAPI Integration:** Use [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) for AI-powered image generation. Implemented in `image_tools.py`.
  - **Unsplash API Integration:** Alternatively, generate images via [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers). Implemented in `image_tools2.py`.
  - **Image backend selection:** Modify the import on `mongodb_database.py`  
    ```python
    from image_tools2 import search_and_download_image
    ```
    to select either method based on your preferences and API accessibility.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
- (Optional) [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) for GPU inference
- Llama 3 70B or compatible model weights
- [SerpAPI Key](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key) (for SerpAPI image generation)
- [Unsplash Access Key](https://unsplash.com/developers) (for Unsplash image generation)

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YUGESHKARAN/ai_product_agent.git
   cd ai_product_agent/flask-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   - Create a `.env` file in `flask-ai/`:
     ```
     MODEL_PATH=/absolute/path/to/llama3-70b
     SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key        # Optional, for SerpAPI image generation
     UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_key  # Optional, for Unsplash image generation
     ```
   - (Adjust `MODEL_PATH` and API keys as needed for your environment.)

### Running the Server

```bash
python app.py
```
- The API will default to `http://localhost:8000` unless otherwise configured.

---

## 🌐 Usage

- The Flask backend exposes endpoints for AI-powered analysis, inference, and image generation.
- Integrate with your main backend/frontend via HTTP requests.

### Image Generation

- You can choose which image generation backend to use:
  - **SerpAPI:** Utilizes `image_tools.py`—requires `SERPAPI_KEY`.
  - **Unsplash:** Utilizes `image_tools2.py`—requires `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`.
- To select your preferred backend, modify the import in `mongodb_database.py` as described above.

### Example API Usage

- **Analysis Endpoint:**
  ```
  POST /analyze
  {
    "product_data": {...}
  }
  ```
  Response:
  ```json
  {
    "analysis": "LLM-powered insights here."
  }
  ```

- **Image Generation (Example):**
  ```
  POST /generate-image
  {
    "prompt": "modern workspace"
  }
  ```
  Response (URL or image data, depending on backend and implementation).

---

## 🛡️ Security

- The backend is intended for internal use behind your main application’s authentication layer.
- Set up firewall rules and/or JWT authentication if exposing to public networks.
